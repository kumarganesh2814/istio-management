# Istio Management
## Overview
This repository contains shell scripts designed to simplify the management of Istio, a powerful service mesh platform. The scripts cover essential activities such as installation, upgrade, rollback, and the ability to take a dump of the existing Istio setup. These scripts are particularly useful for managing both the Control Plane and Data Plane upgrades of Istio.

## Prerequisites
Before using these scripts, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

### Istioctl: 
Install Istioctl, the command-line utility for interacting with Istio. For more information on Istioctl installation, refer to the official [Istioctl documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/diagnostic-tools/istioctl/)

### kubectl: 
Install kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. For more information on kubectl installation, refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

## Note
Make sure that you have targeted the correct Kubernetes cluster before using these scripts. Although certain measures have been taken to avoid unintended cluster usage, it is crucial to verify your cluster context to prevent any accidental changes.

## Usage
Installation
To install Istio using the script, run the following command:

```./istio-install.sh ```
This script will automate the installation process, ensuring a smooth setup of Istio in your Kubernetes cluster.

Upgrade
For upgrading Istio, use the following command:


```./istio-upgrade.sh <new_version> ```
Replace <new_version> with the desired Istio version. This script streamlines the upgrade process for both the Control Plane and Data Plane components.

Rollback
In case of issues with the upgraded version, you can rollback to the previous version using:

```./istio-rollback.sh ```

This script reverts Istio to the previous version, providing a quick and reliable rollback mechanism.

Dump
To take a dump of the existing Istio setup for diagnostic purposes, use:
```./diag.sh```

This script captures relevant information about your Istio configuration, aiding in troubleshooting and analysis.
